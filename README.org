#+title: Readme

* Project Title
This Repo is a try to rebuild the [[https://github.com/ardanlabs/service][Service - Repo from ArdanLabs]], in an effort to learn more about Go, Domain-Driven architecture, Kubernnetes and others.

** Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a file named =.env= in the project root directory.
2. Add the following content to the =.env= file:
   #+begin_src shell
   #!/usr/bin/env zsh
   export GO_VERSION=      # Specify the desired Golang version
   export SERVER_ADDRESS=  # Specify the server address
   export HOST_PORT=       # Specify the host machine address
   #+end_src
3. Update the values as needed

** Building and Running the Application
*** Makefile

The project includes a Makefile with the following commands:
- =build=: Build the Docker containers.
- =up=: Start the Docker containers in the background.
- =down=: Stop and remove the Docker containers.
- =test=: Run tests in the Golang server container.
- =unit_test=: Run tests on local machine
- =restart=: Restart the Docker containers.

To run these commands, execute the following in the terminal:
#+begin_src bash
make <command>
#+end_src

*** Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the Golang server application. To build the image, run the following command:
#+begin_src bash
docker build -t golang-server .
#+end_src

*** docker-compose.yml

The =docker-compose.yml= file defines a service for the Golang server, exposing port 3000. To start the service using Docker Compose, run:
#+begin_src bash
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

To stop the service, run:
#+begin_src bash
docker-compose down
#+end_src
